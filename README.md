This repository contains the official implementation of our paper **SAINT**: **S**elf-**A**ttention Augmented **I**nception-Inside-Inception **N**e**t**work Improves Protein Secondary Structure Prediction.

If you use any part of this repository, we shall be obliged if you site our paper [**SAINT**: **S**elf-**A**ttention Augmented **I**nception-Inside-Inception **N**e**t**work Improves Protein Secondary Structure Prediction](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/786921v1).

# Usage

## Download pretrained-model weights:
1. Please download all the pretrained model weights from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mjXUfz33asJHBorEeMU0kd1A-1WChRyR) (4 weight-files for 4 single-models).
2. Place these four weight-files in the folder "SAINT".

## Input Features
To store input-features, navigate to the folder SAINT. Then follow any of the following two options:
### Option-1
1. List all the protein-names in the file: list_test

2. Place the FASTA, PSSM, HHM, and Spotcon (contact map generated by [Spot-Contact](https://sparks-lab.org/server/spot-contact/)) files for these proteins into the folder: Test

### Option-2
1. If you have a list of proteins in a text file (each in a new line. Last line of the file is a blank line) and a folder containing the FASTA, PSSM, HHM, and Spotcon files of these proteins, you can simply set their path in SAINT/config.py file.

## Run inference to predict secondary structures
1. From command line cd to "SAINT" folder (where SAINT_ensemble.py is situated).

2. In order to run inference with our complete SAINT (ensemble), please run the following command:

  > python SAINT_ensemble.py
  
3. If you want to run inference only with the PSSM, HHM, and Physical-Property features (Without SpotCon), please run the following command:

  > python SAINT_single_base_model.py
  
# Output format
1. The predicted outout sequences will be saved in the following files in the "SAINT/outputs" folder:  
	-*Ensemble*: SAINT_Ensemble_output_ss8_sequences.txt  
	-*No Contact-Map*: SAINT_cwin0_output_ss8_sequences.txt  
	-*Contact Window size 10*: SAINT_cwin10_output_ss8_sequences.txt  
	-*Contact Window size 20*: SAINT_cwin20_output_ss8_sequences.txt  
	-*Contact Window size 50*: SAINT_cwin50_output_ss8_sequences.txt  
 2. Each new line contains Protein 8 state secondary structure for each protein in the above-mentioned list (in the same order).
